# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

I used starter code for the project from Lighthouse-Labs as a student there. Building upon it with their guidence, learning new skills along the way, and sharpening the ones I already possessed. It involves, to some degree: HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end code, then Node, Express and MongoDB back-end. With a focus on the front-end for this project.
